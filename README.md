Tastydir - an AJAX file manager and directory listing
===================

This repo contains Tastydir, a PHP file manager I made when I was 16. I put it up on CodeCanyon and it sold quite well — it was my first real project. It's archived here for sentimental reasons. :)

Please don't use it!

Introduction
------------
Tastydir is a cross-platform PHP file management system which allows you to not only replace your traditional FTP client but also allow your users to view directories in a much more aesthetically pleasing way. 

Installation
------------
Simply upload everything to a directory of your choice.
	
Documentation
------------
Look at the /doc directory in your browser for detailed documentation.
	
Permission problems?
------------
Your PHP scripts may be running as the 'nobody' user (you can check this in the info tooltip in Tastydir).
This is common on many shared hosts, and it means that Tastydir won't be able to edit files created with FTP.
SOLUTION: when you upload files with FTP or via cPanel, make sure you chmod them to 777.
